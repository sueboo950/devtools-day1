# Web Debugging and Optimization Exercise

## Overview

This exercise is designed to improve your skills in web debugging and optimization. You will be working with an intentionally flawed web application. Your task is to identify and document the problems in the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Instructions

Copy this README.md into your Devtools REPO in a new MD file called Day-5.md

### Step 1: Identify Problems

Go through the provided files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`). Each file contains several marked problems (indicated by comments like `<!-- Problem 1: -->`, `/* Problem 5: */`, etc.). Your task is to identify what each problem is and why it is an issue.

### Step 2: Document Each Problem

In this README.md file, document each problem. Write a sentence for each problem explaining what the issue is and why it's problematic. Use the format below for your documentation:

#### Problem 1:

- Description: [Your explanation here]

#### Problem 2:

- Description: [css call link was outside the headtags]

#### Problem 3:

- Description: [class id was not assigned to an element in the html]

#### Problem 4:

- Description: [Image too big for ARIA compliance, / at close, and missing alt for ARIA compliance]

#### Problem 5:

- Description: [We want the external version of our js files called proir to any linked scripts]

#### Problem 6:

- Description: [!Important is know longer needed in style sheet]

#### Problem 7:

- Description: [Image size in style sheet was out of ARIA compliance]

#### Problem 8:

- Description: [No need for unused styles.]

#### Problem 9:

- Description: [n/a no problem found/skipped]

#### Problem 10:

- Description: [Javascript is correct]

[Continue with the remaining problems]

### Step 3: Propose Solutions

For each identified problem, propose a solution or an optimization strategy. Briefly describe how you would fix the issue.

#### Problem 1:

- Solution: [Entered meta data]

#### Problem 2:

- Solution: [repositioned the style sheet link]

#### Problem 3:

- Solution: [changed the class ID]

#### Problem 4:

- Solution: [Changed size of image, removed /, and entered alt for ARIA compliance]

#### Problem 5:

- Solution: [Changed the order of scripts linked]

#### Problem 6:

- Solution: [Removed !Important from body styling]

#### Problem 7:

- Solution: [Corrected image size to match that of HTML for ARIA compliance]

#### Problem 8:

- Solution: [Removed unused styling from style sheet.]

#### Problem 9:

- Solution: [n/a no problem present. skipped]

#### Problem 10:

- Solution: [dev tools is not showing any javascript errors.]

[Continue with solutions for the remaining problems]

### Step 4: Reflect

After completing the exercise, write a brief reflection on what you learned from this debugging and optimization process. Discuss any new insights you gained and how you might apply these skills in future projects.

Ive learned to look and read carefully in order to find the problems and all the mistakes, Ive gained new insight on how a little mmistakes that can cause the whole function to not work.

## Submission

Submit this README.md file with all the problems documented and solved, along with your reflection. Ensure that your explanations are clear and concise.

This exercise is an opportunity to practice critical web development skills. Pay close attention to detail and think about how each issue affects the overall performance and user experience of the web application.
